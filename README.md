Short description

This repository contains an Android project built with Gradle and Kotlin. It appears to be a starter Android app created via Android Studio.

Quick start

Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (2020.3+ recommended) or latest
- JDK 11 or newer

Build & run:
1. Open the project in Android Studio (`File → Open` and select the project root).
2. Let Gradle sync and install any required SDK components.
3. Select a device or emulator and run the `app` module.

From command line:

```bash
# Run a Gradle build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Run unit tests
./gradlew test

# Run instrumentation tests (requires device/emulator)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```
